## Usage

This script works best with zsh. For a one-line command to both download and run the script (wget is not installed on the live USB):


`curl -o autoarch.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b-illy/autoarch/main/autoarch.sh && zsh autoarch.sh`


This script will only function properly on an [archlinux](https://archlinux.org/download/) live USB
